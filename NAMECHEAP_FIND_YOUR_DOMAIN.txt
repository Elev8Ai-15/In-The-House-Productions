🎯 YOU NEED TO FIND YOUR ACTUAL DOMAIN

The screenshot shows SERVICES menu, not your domains.

====================================
WHERE TO FIND YOUR DOMAIN:
====================================

Try these in Namecheap:

1. Look for "Domain List" button/link
   - Might be at the top
   - Might be a separate menu item
   - NOT in the "Domains" dropdown menu

2. Try the ACCOUNT menu instead
   - Look for "Dashboard" 
   - Look for "My Domains"
   - Look for "Domain List"

3. Or go directly to this URL:
   https://ap.www.namecheap.com/domains/list

====================================
FASTER SOLUTION - USE CLOUDFLARE DNS:
====================================

Since Namecheap's mobile interface is confusing,
let's use Cloudflare DNS instead:

1. In your Namecheap domain settings
2. Find where it shows nameservers
3. Change to these Cloudflare nameservers:

   aron.ns.cloudflare.com
   nola.ns.cloudflare.com

4. Then I can add the CNAME in Cloudflare

====================================

pointing to webapp-2mf.pages.dev. Can you help me add this?"

They can add it for you in 5 minutes.

====================================

RECOMMENDATION: Use Cloudflare nameservers OR contact Namecheap support.
